Use the **export_ae_keyframes.jsx** script to export keyframes from After Effects (select a layer and run the script).
The exported txt file can be used to import the keyframes in [p5js](https://p5js.org) or [Processing](https://processing.org). 

### p5js 
you can use **p5js_read_ae_keyframes.js** as setup. Place the txt file in the same folder as the sketch.

### Processing
you can use **processing_read_ae_keyframes.js** as setup. Place the txt file in the data folder of the sketch.
